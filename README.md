# ReMag
a website to resell your magazines

SQL / C# / ASP.NET / Materialize / JavaScript

I would like to get a group together to build this website.  The site will allow a user to create a profile and post there magainzes for resell.  Funds will be sent and received using paypal.  I am open to various options.  We will be using Googles Materialize framework.

Join Me on Discord and lets talk about it !!

So far the site looks like this.  DB is accessable via Azure.
