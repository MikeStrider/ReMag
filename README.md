# ReMag
a website to resell your magazines

SQL / C# / ASP.NET / Materialize

I would like to get a group together to build this website.  The site will allow a user to create a profile and post there magainzes for resell.  Funds will be sent and received using paypal.  I am open to various options.  We will be using Googles Materialize framework.

So far the site looks like this.  DB is accessable via Azure.
